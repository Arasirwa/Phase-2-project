    "### Business Context Clarifications:\n",
    "4. **What size studio are we targeting?** (Independent/small budget vs. major studio competitor?)\n",
    "5. **Are there any genre restrictions?** (Family-friendly only, or open to all ratings?)\n",
    "6. **Geographic focus?** (Domestic US market, international, or global?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Scope Considerations:\n",
    "7. **Should we consider streaming/digital revenue or just theatrical box office?**\n",
    "8. **Do we want to analyze competitor studios' strategies?**\n",
    "9. **Should seasonal trends consider COVID-19 impact on recent years?**\n",

    "- **Box Plot:** Revenue distribution by genre (shows variability and outliers)\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot:** Budget vs. Revenue by genre (profitability insights)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Budget Optimization**\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot with Trend Line:** Budget vs. ROI (sweet spot identification)\n",
    "- **Histogram:** Distribution of profitable budget ranges\n",
    "- **Bubble Chart:** Budget vs. Revenue (bubble size = profit margin)\n",
